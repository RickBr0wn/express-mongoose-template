# Express & MongoDB template

This is a boilerplate template for speeding up the development process in making MERN apps.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get this boilerplate running locally you will need:

- a node package manager (yarn or npm)
- a command line terminal (iTerm or bash)
- your favorite IDE (vscode, sublime)
- mongoDB installed locally

If you want to use a cloud based solution such as [mLabs](https://mlab.com) that is fine, you just need to replace the `connection string` withe one provided.

### Installing

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RickBr0wn/express-mongoose-template <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> && cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

To start your own repository,

> **important:** make sure you are in the cloned directory.

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
```

This will remove the existing git history, and allow you to link it to a new repository.

> Please credit this boilerplate if you build something fantastic!
